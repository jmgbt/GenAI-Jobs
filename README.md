# GenAI Jobs

GenAI-Jobs

GenAI-Jobs is a personal project designed to structure and partially automate the job search process, from job offer collection to the generation of tailored CVs and cover letters in PDF format using generative AI.

The project deliberately avoids full automation of applications and instead focuses on building a controlled, transparent, and extensible pipeline, where automation supports human decision-making rather than replacing it.

🎯 Project Goals

- Centralize job offers from multiple sources
- Reduce the time spent on repetitive tasks during job search
- Generate customized CVs and cover letters based on a single source of truth
- Maintain full human control over whether and how applications are sent
- Build a robust, testable, and modular pipeline

🧠 Why this project?

Modern job searching is caught between two extremes:
- mass application tools that sacrifice quality,
- and fully manual processes that are time-consuming and inefficient.

GenAI-Jobs explores a middle ground.

Instead of automatically sending applications at scale, the project automates what is repetitive and mechanical (offer collection, document adaptation, formatting), while keeping intentional human validation at the core of the process.

The project is both:
- a personal productivity tool,
- and an experimentation ground for applying generative AI in a realistic, constrained workflow.

🧠 Core Design Principles

- Single source of truth: the CV content lives in cv_default.md
- No sensitive data committed: all secrets via environment variables
- Explicit control: no automatic submission of applications
- Incremental automation: each step is testable in isolation
- Readable outputs: clean, professional PDFs suitable for real applications

🤖 CV & Cover Letter Generation
CV
- Generated from cv_default.md
- Adapted to each job offer using AI
- Exported as a single-page, styled PDF
- Formatting handled programmatically (no LaTeX dependency)

Cover Letter
- Fully generated by AI (no static template)
- Uses both the job offer and the adapted CV as context
- Dedicated PDF layout (header, recipient block, body)

🔌 Job Sources
France Travail
- Official API
- OAuth2 authentication
- Fully automated
- Status: ✅ stable

Indeed
- No official public API
- Light HTML scraping (personal use only)
- Daily fetch recommended
- Status: 🚧 in progress

LinkedIn
- No server-side scraping (high ban risk)
- Manual addition via bookmarklet / Airtable form
- Intentional design choice
- Status: ✅ manual by design

🗂 Airtable Usage
Airtable acts as the central coordination layer.

Minimal required fields:
- Title
- URL
- Source
- Status

Generated documents (CV, letter) are not stored in Airtable, only produced locally when needed.

🚀 Running Locally
# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Run full worker pipeline
python worker/worker.py


Tests:

python worker/test_cv_pipeline.py
python worker/fetch_francetravail.py

🔐 Configuration

Environment variables (via .env file):

OPENAI_API_KEY=...
AIRTABLE_API_KEY=...
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=...

FRANCE_TRAVAIL_CLIENT_ID=...
FRANCE_TRAVAIL_CLIENT_SECRET=...


The .env file is intentionally excluded from version control.

⚙️ Technical Choices & Rationale

Markdown as intermediate format
→ readable, editable, model-friendly, easy to post-process

ReportLab for PDF generation
→ full layout control, no external dependencies, reproducible builds

Airtable as orchestration layer
→ fast iteration, human-readable, easy manual intervention

No full automation of applications
→ avoids legal, ethical, and platform-related risks

Separation of concerns
→ fetchers, generators, exporters, and orchestrator are decoupled

⚖️ Disclaimer

This project is strictly personal and experimental.

It does not aim to bypass platform protections, automate mass applications, or violate terms of service.
All automation is designed to remain transparent, limited, and user-controlled.
